Vesta is a unified control plane for managing blockchain nodes and services. Unlike other tools in this space, Vesta provides a unique set of features that set it apart from the rest:

- **Simplicity**: Vesta runs nodes as Docker containers, streamlining the deployment process by eliminating the need for external schedulers (i.e. docker-compose). Vesta simplifies the deployment process and reduces the number of dependencies that users need to manage.
- **Flexibility**: Vesta allows for deployment descriptions to be written in [imperative language](./concepts/plugins), which are easier to maintain and provide a higher level of detail than template engines. This flexibility makes it easier to create end-to-end integrations and ensure that systems are properly configured from deployment onwards.
- **Integration**: With its second-day operations, Vesta enables users to manage metrics, logs, syncing status, and other key functions without requiring additional sidecar operations. This streamlines post-deployment maintenance and makes it easier for users to keep their systems up-to-date and running smoothly.

We want to emphasize that we do not aim to criticize or belittle other projects in this space. Rather, our goal is to provide a guide on what sets Vesta apart and how it differs from other tools available.

## Sedge

[`Sedge`](https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge) is a command tool that offers a one-click node setup for Ethereum chains. It generates `docker-compose` files for the most common Ethereum clients using text templates. Additionally, it provides abstraction commands to further streamline the process of running the `docker-compose` files.

`Vesta` is an end-to-end control plane that manages the configuration, deployment, and day-two operational management (metrics, logs, sync state tracking) of the nodes. `Vesta` is a modular system that enables the execution of not only Ethereum chains.

`Vesta` does not use `docker-compose` but it includes its own local scheduler to run the nodes more efficiently. This makes it possible to run it as a single lightweight process without any dependencies (except for `Docker`). `Vesta` does not use template engines to describe the node deployments but imperative code that provide more flexibility and verbosity.

A tool that is similar to `Sedge` is [`eth-docker`](https://github.com/eth-educators/eth-docker), the main difference is that `eth-docker` uses bash scripts to generate the `docker-compose` files. Also, `eth-docker` is not a CLI tool but a `git` repository that has to be cloned independently for each chain deployment.
