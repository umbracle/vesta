# Validator stack

## Challenge

Optimal configuration of an Ethereum validator stack.

Set up and running a stack for validating Ethereum networks presents several significant challenges. It requires a high level of technical expertise, including choosing the correct combination of Ethereum clients (validator, beacon, execution, mev-boost). Installing and configuring the software correctly is crucial, as is selecting the right version and updating it regularly. In addition to the setup process, following best practices and ensuring the security of the node and its contents is essential.

## Solution

A modular blockchain control plane that is simple to set up and manage.

Use `Vesta` to deploy in a few clicks an optimal Ethereum stack that follows security best practices and includes out-of-the-box resource usage monitoring. Users can use `Vesta` to track client updates, new forks, asses the priorities, and update automatically the deployments.
