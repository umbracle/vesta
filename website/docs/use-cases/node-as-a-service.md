# Node as a service

## Challenge

Managing blockchain nodes beyond the initial deployment is challenging.

Deploying and managing a production blockchain node can be a challenging task. After the initial rollout, day two operations become critical to continuously monitor and maintain the node over time. This includes checking for software updates, troubleshooting issues, handling specific client nuances, following best practices, and monitoring resource usage and performance metrics to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

## Solution

One simple workflow to deploy, manage and monitor blockchain nodes at scale.

`Vesta` provides a consistent and uniform workflow to manage a wide variety of blockchain nodes. The control plane includes first-class support for utilities (metrics and logs monitoring, sync state tracking, etcâ€¦) that would otherwise have to be implemented as external services.
